# FAQ

### How does koi work?
To parse arguments, koi first builds up _argument lists_ with each `__addarg` call. These lists hold information about the arguments registered for each function (whether it be a subcommand or a `__koimain`). When it comes time to parse arguments with `__parseargs`, koi refers to the built argument lists to determine how to parse each argument.

### What is koi written in?
Koi is written entirely in Bash.

### Why do some functions need to start with two underscores?
When koi uses subcommands, it uses the functions defined in the script as available subcommands. In order for koi to treat a function as internal and not display it as an available CLI subcommand, koi ignores functions that begin with an underscore (`_`) or a dash (`-`). Thus, if you are using subcommands, you can define a function whose name begins with two underscores and koi will treat it as internal.

### Why can't I nest functions that parse arguments?
When koi parses arguments, it builds a list of registered arguments and actual arguments in the global scope. When two functions try to parse arguments in the same scope, they both write to the list of registered arguments, which makes parsing arguments ambiguous. It is possible to get around this with the [`__cleararglists` function](/helpers?id=__cleararglists) (as is done in the [`help` function](/using_subcommands?id=help)), but doing so is not advised in most cases.

### Are there any illegal names for registered options?
Yes, there are few names that cannot be used as the long option when registering arguments, due to the fact that they would overwrite internal variables. The following cannot be used as long options: `--BASH` `--BASH_ENV` `--BASH_SUBSHELL` `--BASHPID` `--BASH_VERSINFO` `--BASH_VERSION` `--CDPATH` `--DIRSTACK` `--EDITOR` `--EUID` `--FUNCNAME` `--GLOBIGNORE` `--GROUPS` `--HOME` `--HOSTNAME` `--HOSTTYPE` `--IFS` `--IGNOREEOF` `--LC_COLLATE` `--LC_CTYPE` `--LINENO` `--MACHTYPE` `--OLDPWD` `--OSTYPE` `--PATH` `--PIPESTATUS` `--PPID` `--PROMPT_COMMAND` `--PS1` `--PS2` `--PS3` `--PS4` `--PWD` `--REPLY` `--SECONDS` `--SHELLOPTS` `--SHLVL` `--TMOUT` `--UID` `--koiname` `--koidescription` `--koihelpmenuprefix` `--koiwordwraplength` `--koishowhints` `--koicolorprimary` `--koicolorsecondary` `--koirequirehelpactions`.

### Can koi parse joint options?
Yes, koi can parse joint options. For more information about parsing joint arguments, please see [Parsing joint arguments](/parsing_arguments?id=parsing-joint-arguments).

### Can koi parse mutually exclusive groups?
Yes, koi can parse mutually exclusive groups. For more information, see [Using argument groups](/using_argument_groups).

### What are hints?
Hints are printed in autogenerated help menus. By default they are printed at the bottom of regular help menus and omitted in verbose help menus. They can be turned off via koi configurations (see [Configuration](/configuration)).

### Can I contribute to koi?
Yes, koi is under active development and welcomes contributions. For more information on how to get started, check out [Contributing](/development?id=contributing).

### Why is it called koi?
The original working name of the library was _Bashful Arg Parser_, which is a mouthful. This was shortened to _Bashful_, to which _coy_ is a synonym. _koi_ is a homophone of _coy_ and thus was chosen as the name.
