  BREAKING: UK #coronavirus deaths rise again - 870 more victims recorded in 
  past 24hrs. 
  Total now heading over 14,000.
  This doesn't include 1000s more who are believed to have died in care homes & 
  at home.
  This is a devastating ongoing catastrophe.

  The #coronavirus crisis is a public health emergency that called for a 
  coordinated federal response based on science, evidence, and data from Day 1. 
  It still does.
   
  Testing, testing, testing ‚Äì only ‚Äì can tell us where it is and who is impacted 
  as the basis for the way forward.

  It seems that out of sheer embarrassment at issuing preposterously bad 
  projections, the CDC is now counting ‚Äúprobable‚Äù #Coronavirus cases to boost the 
  numbers and the death count. In short, the new data will no longer be 
  trustworthy and can be viewed as self-serving propaganda

  Will governors (and mayors) arrest desperate Americans on food bank lines 
  who aren't wearing masks or aren't social distancing?  The best way to protect

  New York boosted its #Coronavirus death toll by 30% by throwing in a bunch
