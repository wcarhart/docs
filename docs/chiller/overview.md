Chiller is a collection of helpful tools for managing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) taps via [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories. Install with `brew install wcarhart/tools/chiller`.

## Example {docsify-ignore}

For example, suppose you had a new release in GitHub that you'd like to be available with Homebrew. You can easily update your new release in your tap:
```bash
pwd
# ~/mytap
chiller update mycooltool
# Updated formula for 'mycooltool' to latest (v2.0.0)
git push                   # push your local tap
brew upgrade mycooltool    # upgrade mycooltool
```
Or, perhaps you'd like to change to a specific version:
```bash
pwd
# ~/mytap
chiller change --version v1.0.0 mycooltool
# Changed formula for 'mycooltool' to v1.0.0
git push                   # push your local tap
brew upgrade mycooltool    # upgrade mycooltool
```
You can also easily generate SHA256 hashes:
```bash
chiller sha ./mycooltool
# 082784d0153fd64bedf80901391e53f0d8b1181f9394886b14154f81a4e48ffb
```
